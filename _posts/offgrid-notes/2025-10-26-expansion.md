Solar energy generation system expansion plan for the next 6 months.

## Timeline

### Month 1

Replace current panels with 6 new 585W panels, for a total generation potential of 3.5kW
Cost: 6x R$589.99, total of R$ 3,539.94.
Note: depending on financial situation, I want to see if I can buy 10 panels instead of 6. Thus reaching 5.8kW generation
With total cost of R$5,899.90

### Month 2

Add 6 more 585W solar panels, expanding the system to 7kW generation potential
Cost: 6x R$589.99, total of R$ 3,539.94.
Note: depending on financial situation, I want to see if I can buy 10 panels instead of 6. Expanding total generation to 11.7kW
With total cost of R$5,899.90

### Month 3

Replace lead-acid batteries with a 200Ah 5kW 24V lithium battery (Felicity LPBF24200)
Cost: R$ 6,378.99

### Month 4

Add another 200Ah 4.8kW 24V lithium battery (Felicity LPBF24200), expanding system storage capacity to 9.6kW
Cost: R$ 6,378.99

### Month 5

The old panels and batteries will be used exclusively for office power, running a dedicated 12V DC installation, powering LED lights and laptop charger with a step-up voltage converter to 20V (which the laptop consumes) and a PoE converter for the wifi router.

This would be 2 intact 250W panels and two with broken glass but still functioning. And removing the damaged batteries, I should end up with a storage capacity between 60Ah and 180Ah 12V (720W~2160W)

Office consumption calculation:
-Laptop: 20V 6.75A = 135W
-Lighting: 12V 2A = 24W
-Router: 12V 2A = 24W
-Total: 183W

Depending on how much battery I can recover, I can achieve 2 to 6 hours of autonomy, considering a 50% battery discharge rate.
It's not much but it's enough for use during business hours for my work. And if more energy is needed, it's always possible to recharge the office batteries from the house's main grid, which at this point should have a generation capacity between 7kW and 11.7kW and 9.6kW storage.
