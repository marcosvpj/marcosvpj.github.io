## Who I Am

![Marcos Pagelkopf](/img/avatar.jpg)

I'm Marcos, a software engineer who after more than a decade writing code in offices and apartments, decided to trade it all for a simpler life in a rural area, powered by solar energy.

## The Journey

### The early years (2010-2017)

I started my career with **PHP and JavaScript**, building e-commerce platforms, ERPs, and custom systems. Those were years of intense learning - I learned not just how to code, but how to understand businesses, deal with clients, and deliver value.

During this period I also worked as a web programming instructor, which taught me that explaining something is the best way to truly understand it.

### The transition to Go (2018)

In 2018, at **Neoway**, I discovered Go. It was love at first sight. The language's simplicity, the performance, the "less is more" philosophy - everything resonated with how I wanted to write software.

I spent 4 years building scrapers, data pipelines, and systems that processed millions of records daily. One of my proudest achievements was refactoring a critical pipeline that took 7 days to run and reducing it to just 1 day.

### Technical leadership (2023-2024)

At **Inovally**, I took on my first technical leadership role. I led a team of 6 developers, consolidated fragmented systems, and established code review and TDD practices that reduced production bugs by 40%.

It was rewarding, but it also showed me that my passion is still technical - solving complex problems with elegant code.

## Off-Grid Life

<!-- TODO: Add photos of your off-grid setup -->
<!-- ![Solar Setup](/img/about/solar-setup.jpg) -->

At some point, I started questioning the traditional model. I've been working remotely since 2017 - why did I need to be in a city?

Today I live in a rural area, where:

- **I generate my own power** with solar panels
- **I connect to the world** via Starlink
- **I work remotely** as I always have
- **I live with less** and enjoy more

It's not perfect. Batteries degrade, the sun doesn't always cooperate, and I've learned more about electricity in the last few years than in my entire life. But every challenge is a learning experience, and every solution is a victory.

## Beyond Code

Programming is my profession, but it's not all that defines me.

**Travel** taught me that the world is bigger than any computer screen. From the [rally in Argentina](/en/posts/wrc-rally-argentina-2016/) to the [trails of Santa Catarina](/en/posts/toca-do-indio-benedito-novo-sc/), each trip left its mark.

**Photography** is my way of preserving moments. I'm not a professional, but I enjoy capturing what I see - whether it's a landscape or a detail that went unnoticed.

**Books** are shortcuts. Through them, I learn from others' experiences without having to make the same mistakes. My [reading list](/en/livros/) reflects this constant search for knowledge.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm looking for **100% technical positions** in backend development, where I can:

- Solve complex scale and performance problems
- Work with Go and distributed systems
- Contribute to teams that value code quality
- Maintain the flexibility of remote work
