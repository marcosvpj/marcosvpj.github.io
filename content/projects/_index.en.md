## My Philosophy

I believe life is made of experiments. Every project is an opportunity to learn, fail, and grow. I don't seek perfection - I seek progress.

Here I record these experiments - they're not complete, polished, and finished projects. I rarely finish anything, because when an experiment works, I move on to the next one. But occasionally a new idea or question arises and I end up revisiting and expanding old experiments.

When I work on something, I like to follow the [TDD](/en/posts/using-the-problem-to-solve-the-problem/) (Test Driven Development) philosophy. I like to know what the finish line is before I start and discover the path as I go.

My projects are divided into three main areas that reflect different parts of who I am:

## Project Areas

### [Off-grid](/en/categories/off-grid/)

Living off the conventional power grid is more than a practical choice - it's a philosophy of life. Here I document my journey building a solar power system, facing the challenges of rural living, and seeking greater autonomy and sustainability.

**Topics:** Solar energy, batteries, autonomous systems, rural living

### [Art](/en/categories/art/)

Art is a strange category because anything can be art. In my case, I make art with code, with pen and paper, with a camera, or with pots and a stove. To succeed, art doesn't need to be beautiful, it doesn't need to make sense - it just needs to generate some emotion in those who experience it. Here I record the experiences that worked following this metric.

**Topics:** Photography, travel, books, recipes

### [Technology](/en/categories/technology/)

Programming is my profession and my passion. Here I share technical learnings, development tips, and reflections on the art of writing software.

**Topics:** Code, Bugs, Prototypes
