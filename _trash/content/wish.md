/wish

Sincerity publicizes all the warts and blemishes of the mind. My wishlist is honest and sometimes embarassing. Many of my wants are contradictory, naive, selfish, immature, etc. But in spite of my discomfort, public /wish lists are sustainable.

This list contains prices for new items, but purchase pre-owned where possible!

Anyway, enjoy the meager dreams of my meat CPU:
charities, lifestyle, books, diy, music, home, art, tech, fashion.

Lifestyle

    to not make Earth worse
    to giggle and laugh all day
    to have a maximalist workshop with every type of tool and gadget
    to give people resources to work on amazing things
    to live surrounded by nature
    to be surrounded by deep and wonderful minds
    to go on big adventures a few times per year
    to live in a place where people participate in their community
    to go monk-mode for weeks at a time and work on projects
    to be involved in public conversations
    to have effortless income rather than maximum income
    to live a while
    to have an outdoor shower and a sauna
    to dent my bucket list
    to celebrate novelty
    no bosses, no masters, and no obligations
    to make things
    to be surrounded by friends
    to share everything I learn
    to live in an austere minimalist architectural home
    to live in different places for a 3-9 months of each year
    to be surrounded by ruses, pranks, projects, ideas, and moonshots
    to walk everywhere
